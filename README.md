# Point-Transformer-Cls
My own (unofficial) implementation of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09164">Point Transformer</a> Network, currently for classification tasks. 


Since the authors did not release the detailed network architectures, I set the feature dimensions of the hidden layer at will and keep the #points as 1024. Hope for more details!
